# How to Start Using Fudis in Your Application

Fudis is available as [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/ngx-fudis)

## 1. Compatibility

The library is build and tested against:

- Angular: **v19.2**
- Angular Material: **v19.2**
- Fudis Core: **v2.0**

> We recommend using these versions in your project. Newer major versions may work, but are not yet tested or guaranteed to be compatible.

## 2. Install Angular Material Peer Dependency:

```
ng add @angular/material

```

> This command will also include Angular CDK, which is mandatory for Angular Material to work properly.

Choose these options when prompted:

```
? Choose a prebuilt theme name, or "custom" for a custom theme: Custom
? Set up global Angular Material typography styles? No
? Include the Angular animations module? Include and enable animations
```

## 3. Install Fudis-Core Peer Dependency:

Fudis has a peer dependency to our style library, that contains global styles, mixins and tokens.

```
ng add @funidata/fudis-core

```

After installing the dependency, follow the setup instructions from [Fudis Core Storybook](https://fudis.funidata.fi/core) which are located in the **Documentation -> Introduction -> How to start using Core**-section.

## 4. Install Fudis:

```
ng add @funidata/ngx-fudis

```

## 5. Import Fudis in Applications's `app.module.ts`

Check your application's `app.module.ts` file that Fudis is imported correctly.

```
import { NgxFudisModule } from '@funidata/ngx-fudis';

@NgModule({
	...
	imports: [
		...
		NgxFudisModule
	],
	...
})
```

## 6. Import global styles

The global styles of Fudis must be imported to your application's styles for components to work properly. As Fudis uses Angular Material as its dependency, it is already imported as part of Fudis' main CSS file.

The recommended way is to add following lines your project's root SCSS style file, which is often named `styles.scss` or `index.scss` or similar:

```
@use '@funidata/ngx-fudis';
```
