# How to Contribute

Fudis Design System is open for new development contributions in - and outside of Funidata company.

## Before contributing

**All Fudis Design System proposals must be generic and they must solve commonly repeated challenges across learning services.** If the proposal is considered as project spesific, it will be discarded.
Therefore, it's important to define the scope of your proposal — whether it's an improvement to an existing component or a completely new feature. The best way to get started is by becoming familiar with the existing Fudis component library.
In addition to new feature proposals, contributions may include bug fixes or just documentation update requests. Do not hesitate to contact Fudis team in advance for help and guidance.

## Contribution guidelines (external developer):

- Define your implementation proposal.
- [Contact Fudis Team](/docs/documentation-introduction-welcome--documentation#contact) in order to find best way contribute.
  - **Note!** New features require a design that Fudis team will provide consultancy on.
