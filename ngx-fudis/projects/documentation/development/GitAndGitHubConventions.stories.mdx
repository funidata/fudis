# Git and GitHub Conventions

## Branch Naming

- Always aim branch to have a descriptive branch name
- If your work is part of Jira ticket, include ticket number as prefix
- Examples
  - DS-1337-navigation-component-ver-1
  - DS-42-grid-service-part-2-refactoring-types
  - feat-breadcrumbs-component-ver-1
  - deps-update-dependencies-2023-05

## Commit Messages

- Always aim commit to have a descriptive commit message
- If your work is part of Jira ticket, include ticket number as prefix
- If your work is not part of Jira ticket, add descriptive abbreviation 'label' prefix
  - E. g. feat, deps, fix, docs, impr etc.
- Examples
  - DS-1337: Create boilerplate for NavigationComponent
  - DS-1337: Add first unit tests for NavigationComponent
  - impr: add lite variant for ExpandableComponent
  - fix: adjust body-text margin styles
  - docs: add Storybook page for Git and GitHub conventions
  - deps: update ng and ngMaterial to latest v16

## PR Labels

- Always add label to PR
  - Label is used in Release Notes generation to categorise PRs related to latest release
- If you add more than one label, the one with higher priority will be used with release notes
  - Priority list can be seen in 'release.yml' file. where e. g. 'Breaking change' label is the highest priority and 'Dependencies' is the lowest.

## PR Naming

- Title consists of two parts
  - First part: In square brackets the feature, component, area of Fudis work etc. what does the PR affect
    - If the PR work is around multiple areas, it is okay to list more than one
  - Second part: The summary of work done
- Examples
  - \[Documentation]: Add Storybook documentation about Git and GitHub conventions
  - \[GridComponent, GridService]: Add support for responsive 'margins' input attribute
  - \[Types]: Rename types to include 'Fudis' prefix
  - \[NavigationComponent]: First version of the component, documentation and unit tests
  - \[Screenshot tests, Documentation]: Add more screenshot tests and improve documentation about testing

## PR Description

- If PR is part of work for a Jira ticket, always include URL to Jira ticket
- Aim to describe main points of work done in the PR
- If PR has a breaking change, describe what part of code is the breaking change one
  - Don't forget to add 'Breaking change' label as well
