# Naming Conventions

Fudis Design System uses the following naming conventions described in this document. Goals and principles of these conventions are:

- Names are consistent and self-explaining between developers, designers and product teams using Fudis
- To reduce load of creating and inventing new names for components, styles etc.
- Maintain consistent project, file and folder structure
- Exceptions can happen, if over-engineering naming causes more confusion than intuitive development experience

## Prefix

Fudis often uses selector prefix **fudis** and **Fudis**. Prefix prevents collision with consumers existing design tokens. Prefix is used in e.g. component's HTML selector, CSS/SCSS class names and utility functions.

## Components

Fudis core team has decided that component name's should be intuitive, easy to understand and not over-engineered. To keep things in order, component's are categorised in folders. So that the components from same family can be found together. E. g. form related components live under `components/form` folder and typography components live in `components/typography` folder.

### Angular Component

- **Component** suffix.
- Camel case: First letter of each segment in uppercase
- E. g. `RadioButtonComponent` and `DescriptionListComponent`

### HTML Selector

- **fudis** -prefix
- All lower case
- Kebab case: segments are joined with <code>-</code>.
- E. g. `fudis-radio-button` and `fudis-description-list`

### Component's Input / Output attributes

When defining e.g. component's @Input directives, try to name these consistently between components. E. g. many components have `variant`, `size` and `control` Input, so if you need similar feature to your component, **avoid** naming these differently to something as `variation`, `magnitude` and `controlToFormElement`.

It helps Fudis developers and product developers using Fudis if naming of similar features are consistent, simple and intuitive between components.

## CSS/SCSS Class Names

Fudis aims to follow BEM methodology of block, element and modifier when defining CSS/SCSS class names.

**Block:**

The main star of CSS class name, usually the component itself. Syntax is similar to Angular HTML selector.

E. g. `.fudis-radio-button`, `.fudis-text-input` and `.fudis-grid`

**Element:**

A sub element of the main block segmented with two underscores `__`. It is good practise to aim that component's HTML and CSS doesn't require too deep nesting.

E. g. `.fudis-radio-button__indicator` and `.fudis-radio-button__indicator__icon`

**Modifier:**

Modifier is most often used the state of component changes. Segmented with two `--` dashes. Often these are related to user actions or similar state of an HTML element. Following example events and states could be considered as BEM modifier when defining CSS class names: `hover`, `active`, `invalid`, `disabled`, `hidden`.

E. g. `.fudis-radio-button__indicator--invalid` and `.fudis-button--active`

## Foundations and Design Tokens

In project's `foundations` folder live the atoms of Fudis DS. These include tokens and variables for e. g. colors, spacing, font-sizes and focus styles and also SCSS mixins to use them consistently.

Naming of these follow the **kebab-case** pattern from least spesific to most spesific part of the foundation element.

### Example SCSS variable token `$spacing-xs`

- `spacing` the main category of the token
- `xs` spesifying the variant / value of the category token

### Example SCSS mixins `focus-generic` and `focus-form-field`

- `focus` as the main category
- `generic` and `form-field` spesifying the variant / value of the category mixin

## TypeScript Interfaces and Types

Currently types and interfaces live in `types` folder. Interfaces and types follow **CamelCase**.

E. g. `DescriptionListItem` and `RadioButtonOption`
