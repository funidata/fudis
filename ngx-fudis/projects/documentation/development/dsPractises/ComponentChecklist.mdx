# Component Checklist

## 1. Component is Imported and Exported Correctly

- ### ngx-fudis.module.ts

  `fudis/ngx-fudis/projects/ngx-fudis/src/lib/ngx-fudis.module.ts` **→ Import, Declaration, Export**

- ### public-api.ts

  `fudis/ngx-fudis/projects/ngx-fudis/src/public-api.ts` **→ Export**

- ### .stories.ts

  **Import** each component in their own `.stories.ts` file.

  If component has ngMaterial or Angular dependencies, check that those are imported in `ngx-fudis.module.ts`. If Story has Story spesific imports or declarations, then include them in `moduleMetadata`.

```
export default {
	title: 'Components/InsertNameHere',
	component: InsertNameHereComponent,
	decorators: [
		moduleMetadata({
			declarations: [StorySpesificComponent],
			imports: ["dependency-1", "dependency-2"],
		}),
	],
} as Meta;
```

## 2. Component Reuses Existing Components as Sub Components.

If similar features repeat in multiple components, consider creating a sub component for easier maintanance.

## 3. Component Follows Naming Conventions

Check [Naming Conventions](/docs/documentation-development-ds-practises-naming-conventions--documentation) documentation if you are not sure about these.

## 4. Components Has Relevant Unit Tests

- Component is created
- Component has working @Inputs and @Outputs
- Features that might break easily by some syntax change should be unit tested. E.g. if component has `[size]` input with values of `sm, md, lg` there should be a test for all of these values, so we can verify that component still works as intended if there are changes in the API.
- Error handling and good practises. E. g. Radio Button group should not be used with less than 2 options, therefore unit tests should check that these principles work and throws an error if group of 1 or 0 is tried to create.
- Utilities should be tested. If component uses utility functions, those utility functions should have unit tests as well.

## 5. Component Has Written Stories

- Story should include the basic version of the component.
- Component variants such as primary, secondary etc. should be documented. These variants should be accessed and controllable through Storybook Controls.
- If needed, create own story for clearly "other/different version" of the component, e.g. Button vs. Button with Icon
- Component all variants, can be documented as story by using Storybook template prop.
  > _Note! This prevents component control through Controls. Template prop should be used mainly for a story spesific readme.mdx documentation._
- Component has ArgTypes.
- Component has its @Inputs and @Outputs listed with description and accepted values.
- Components with event handlers have working actions.
- Disabled and invalid states should be able to switch on from Storybook Controls.
- Form components have functioning formControls for Storybook testing and demo purposes.

## 6. Component Has Readme File

- All component variants and states are documented
- Related accessibility requirements are listed
- Related and sub components are listed
- All Angular Material based components have link to Angular documentation
- ArgTypes are visible

## 7. Component Accessibility Is Tested

- Component is usable and understandable with screen reader
  - Component has proper role and aria-attributes if necessary
- Contrast is checked with Storybook accessibility addon or with some other relevant checking tool
- Component has visible focus style
  > _Note! Disabled form elements receive focus_
- Component supports keyboard controls
