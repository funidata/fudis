# Creating a Component

<br />

## Generate Component

Generate new component to 'components' folder by running following command in `fudis/ngx-fudis` folder:

```
ng generate --project=ngx-fudis component components/new-component-name

```

Or to a spesific directory:

```
ng generate --project=ngx-fudis component components/form/new-form-component
```

## Component Folder Structure

General directory structure can be found in [Project Structure Documentation](/docs/documentation-development-ds-practises-project-structure--documentation).

If component has multiple sub components, they are stored in parent component directory.

```
├── components
├── button				# Component folder
│   	├── button.component.html	# Component template
│   	├── button.component.scss	# Logic-dependent styles that overlap with other components
│   	├── button.component.spec.ts	# Unit tests
│   	├── button.component.ts		# Component file
│   	├── button.stories.ts		# Component story
│   	└── button.mdx			# Storybook doc file
└── ...
