# General Directory Structure

<br />

## Dev

Sandbox application, which uses locally built ngx-fudis package as its dependancy. Note that testing new components and features in sandbox application is not same as testing it in totally separate Angular application.

## Documentation

Self-explaining main location of documentation for product developers and Fudis developers.

## Ngx-fudis

<br />

### Assets

Static asset files, like fonts, SVG icons and similar are located here.

### Components

The molecules of Fudis, the components. Each component folder should contain files related to that spesific component, such as Storybook stories, documentation and unit tests.

### Directives

Folder containing base directives for Fudis components to extend on and directive classes to help add additional behaviour to Fudis components, such as content projection, tooltip and the almighty grid.

### Foundations

**Foundations** section contains the atoms of Fudis DS. Foundations directory contains all project foundation design tokens and mixins. Including tokens and mixins for e. g. borders, breakpoints, colors, spacing and typography. If there is need for a style variable or mixin, which is used in multiple components, usually it should be defined under Foundations.

### Services

Folder containing all services that Fudis components need. These include e.g. alert, breakpoint, focus and id services. Both internal and exposed services live here.

### Theme

Some of Fudis components use components from Angular Material. Theme folder contains theme definitions, which aim to preset default Angular Material theme as near to Fudis as possible.

If you are using ngMaterial component and the default theme doesn't apply colors as you want, proceed with caution if you consider to customise the default theme. Consider instead, if creating a component spesific theme would fix your issue.

### Types

Folder containing types and interfaces used in various Fudis components.

### Utilities

Folder containing utility functions used throughout the project, e.g. form validator and unit test functions.
