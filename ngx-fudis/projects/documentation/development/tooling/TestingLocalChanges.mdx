# Testing Local Changes in Application

Sometimes you need to test your local changes straight away in the application. The Fudis package may be either a symlinked workspace or a packaged tarball.
Instructions cover both NPM and Yarn package managers.

## Testing with Symlink

### NPM

1. Navigate to **ngx-fudis** directory.
2. Build the library: `npm run build:ngx-fudis`. New changes require rebuilding the library again.
3. Go to the **ngx-fudis/dist** directory and run `npm link` that creates a local symlink to the Fudis package.
4. Then navigate to your project where you want to link the Fudis package. The directory that contains the node_modules folder containing the project dependencies is the correct place to execute linking. In this project directory run `npm link @funidata/ngx-fudis`
5. When you want to unlink the package from your project, run the command `npm unlink @funidata/ngx-fudis`. This is done in the same directory in your consuming project, where you linked the package.

### Yarn

These instructions are for Yarn v4. If you are using any other version, please check the corresponding documentation to see how symlinking is done.

1. Navigate to **ngx-fudis** directory.
2. Build the library: `npm run build:ngx-fudis`. New changes require rebuilding the library again.
3. Navigate to your project where you want to use the Fudis package. The directory that contains the node_modules folder containing the project dependencies is the correct place to execute linking.
4. In this project directory run `yarn add @funidata/ngx-fudis@link: ./{your-path-to-fudis-directory}/fudis/ngx-fudis/dist`

## Testing with Tarball

1. Navigate to **ngx-fudis** directory.
2. Build the library: `npm run build:ngx-fudis`. New changes require rebuilding the library again.
3. Go to the **dist/ngx-fudis** directory and run `npm pack`. This will create a tarball file `funidata-ngx-fudis-{version-number}.tgz` in that current directory.
4. Navigate to your project where you want to use the Fudis package. The directory that contains the node_modules folder containing the project dependencies is the correct place to execute linking.
5. In this project directory run the following:
   - **with NPM** `npm install ./{path-to-your-local-tarball-file}`.
   - **with Yarn** `yarn add ./{path-to-your-local-tarball-file}`.
