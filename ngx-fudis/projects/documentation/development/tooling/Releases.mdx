# Releases

New versions are published to NPM using GitHub Releases. After tagging and creating a release on GitHub, an automatic workflow handles packaging and publishing Fudis to NPM.

**Table of Contents**

1. [Versioning](#versioning)
2. [Release Notes](#release-notes)
3. [Release Flow](#release-flow)

## Versioning

Fudis uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

### Patch

Patch updates are interchangeable, meaning clients can upgrade or downgrade freely between versions.\
**Example:** Bug fix, interval tweak.

### Minor

Minor updates are compatible with previous versions and usually includes additional features.\
**Example:** New features, old features declared as deprecated.

### Major

Major changes are backward incompatible and will have breaking changes.\
**Example:** Changes in API endpoint name, remove of an endpoint.

## Release Notes

Release notes for each release can be found from [Github Fudis Releases](https://github.com/funidata/fudis/releases).

## Release Flow

### Create New Release

- Create new release branch from main with respective naming `release-{major.minor.patch}`
- Increment version by running `npm version <major.minor.patch>` in project root
  > This will increment version number in `package.json` files and do automatic commit of the changed files
- Create Pull Request
- Add a label **exclude from release notes**, so this PR won't be listed in release notes.
- Merge created Pull Request
- Go to project's GitHub main page **Releases**
- Select **Draft a new release**
- Select **Choose a tag**. Create new tag in the format of `v{major.minor.patch}`
- If necessary choose from **Previous tag** dropdown, the version you want to compare to. Otherwise use default 'Previous tag: auto'
- Select **Generate release notes**
- Replace **What's Changed** heading with a current date
- Check from **Preview** that everything looks correct
- Check correct release checkbox:

  > Set as pre-release if it is e.g. release candidate for major release

  > Set as latest if it is the newest stable release

- Publish release
- Check that [Fudis NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/ngx-fudis) has updated the newly released version

### Patch Previous Major

- Checkout to the existing **tag** and create new branch with respective naming `release-{major.minor.patch}`
- Create another branch from the release branch where the issue is fixed
- Create pull requests for the fix/fixes and merge to the branch you created for the release (`release-{major.minor.patch}`)
- We also recommend that version increment `npm version <major.minor.patch>` is done in its own branch. The target branch is also the release branch that is mentioned above.
- Make the release from GitHub UI with the same steps as when creating new release but remember to choose correct comparison tags
- Choose **Target** branch according to the release you are updating
- Uncheck both release checkboxes since this is a fix for previously released version
- Publish the release and check that the release is listen in [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/ngx-fudis)

### Problems After Releasing

NPM does not allow modifying published packages to protect downstream dependents. If there is something wrong with a published version, you should release a new version incrementing the version as appropriate.

For extreme cases, there exists an option to unpublish a package from NPM. This should be a last resort as it will break any downstream projects depending on the unpublished version. Note that even unpublishing will not allow you to use the same version again in a release, i.e., it is not a workaround to overwrite a published package. See [NPM Unpublish documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish).

If something goes wrong in the release pipeline before the package has been published to NPM, you should anyhow increment the version and create a new release. This provides clarity and consistency to other Fudis developers as well as users of the library. Please also refrain from removing releases from GitHub and rather edit the release notes to make clear what has wrong and that the package should not be used. The bad code will anyway be forever available in the public repository so it is better to have the problems documented in release notes and thus provide an "audit trail" to users rather than undue surprises.

### Publishing with OIDC

The GitHub Actions workflow resposible for publishing new Fudis releases to the NPM registry uses an OIDC (OpenID Connect) token for authentication. This token is generated dynamically by GitHub Actions during the workflow execution and is used to authenticate against the NPM registry.
The specific workflow is registered as trusted publisher in the NPM settings, meaning that only this workflow is authorized to publish to the package.
There is no need for manual token rotation. The token is valid only for the duration of the workflow and is destroyed after workflow completes.
