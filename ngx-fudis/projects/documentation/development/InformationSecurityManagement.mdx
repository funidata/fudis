Fudis is an open-source project for maintaining and developing a design system for Funidata's web applications.
With each new version release, Fudis Design System developer documentation is deployed to public Storybook and component library as public [package to NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/ngx-fudis). More in depth designs guidelines are maintained in Funidata's private Figma account for the use of Funidata's other products.

## Developing Process and Version Controls Practises

Fudis Design System maintenance responsibility belongs to one development team at Funidata, which administers all project's code contributions.
A third party contributions are governed by a public [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/funidata/fudis/blob/main/CLA).

As a general widely supported Design System development guideline, Fudis components and utilities are dumb user interface building blocks, and it is client application's responsibility to choose what data is passed to the components.

Code review is an important step in Fudis development process to get a second opinion on the solution and implementation. Pull requests cannot be merged before other core developer has approved it.

Fudis coding standards ensure uniformity across codebase, making it easier for developers to read, understand, and maintain code. For example, Typescript's strong typing reduces security risks as with unwanted typed values the build will fail. Various widely supported linters are used to avoid e.g. deprecated functions and other antipatterns.

Fudis uses GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines in delivering newer version of the library. The secret keys required to run various CI/CD actions can only be managed by repository's administrators. GitHub's provided tools e.g. CodeQL analysis and Secret scanning is enabled to automatically catch and prevent possible vulnerabilities.

## Testing Practices

All repository's components and functionalities are expected to have unit tests and visual regression E2E tests. Tests are always run with each pull request, after merging PR to main branch and when running NPM package release script. If tests fail merging and deployment is halted until failed checks are resolved.

## Service Deployment

Setting up the development environment instructions in [here.](/docs/documentation-development-getting-started--documentation)

## Data Handling

Fudis does not have any backend services. Sensitive data is not used in developing and testing, only fake mock data.

## Dependencies

Fudis Design System is developed with Typescript and uses [Angular](https://angular.dev/) framework. Component library extends [Angular Material component library](https://material.angular.io/). Angular Material is also dependency for the published [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/ngx-fudis). Further dependencies can be seen from package.json files. Practices Fudis development team does for better security:

- Chosen third party libraries are widely supported and well maintained.
- Depedencies are updated frequently, roughly once a month.
- GitHub's Dependabot alerts library vulnerabilities and automatically creates pull request to fix those.

## Service Requirements

Fudis Design System is developed according to the latest [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/)
