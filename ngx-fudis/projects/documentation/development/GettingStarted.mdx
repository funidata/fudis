# Getting Started with Development Environment

Setting up your local development environment according to these instructions is highly recommended for a smooth and uniform development experience accross the team (and 3rd parties, too).

## Requirements

- MacOS or Linux
- Git
- Docker
  - Any fairly recent version should work. Originally developed with Docker Engine v24.
- Node.js and NPM
  - For just running Storybook locally, any version will do as the containers will internally use correct versions anyway. If you plan to do anything else, using the version specified in `.nvmrc` is highly recommended (`v20.19.0` at the time of writing this doc).
  - In general, using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and setting your terminal to automatically switch Node.js versions based on `.nvmrc` files is highly recommended.
- IDE with robust support for TypeScript
  - We prefer VS Code and offer a settings template to get going immediately (see [VS Code Setup Instructions](/docs/documentation-development-tooling-setup-vs-code--documentation)).

## Set Up Local Repository

Clone the upstream repository to your machine (requires write access).

```
git clone https://github.com/funidata/fudis.git
```

If you do not have write access and are not working for Funidata, you need to first fork our repository to your own account and use that for development.

## Install Dependencies

To install project dependencies, in the **root** directory run:

```
npm ci
```

## Development

The development is done in the Storybook environment.  Fudis uses webpack middleware for bundling JavaScript. You can read more about Storybook from the [official Storybook site](https://storybook.js.org/).

### With Containers

Make sure Docker daemon is running, then in the **root** directory run:

```
npm start
```
First startup takes a while as Docker fetches and builds necessary images. Once complete, Storybook is accessible at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

Once you are done, shutdown the development environment with `npm stop`. You can use `docker ps` to verify all containers are down (and to check their status if something is not working).

### Without Containers

To start Storybook, navigate to **ngx-fudis** directory and run:

```
npm run storybook
```
