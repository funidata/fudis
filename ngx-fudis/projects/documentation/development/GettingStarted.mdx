# Getting Started with Development Environment

Setting up your local development environment according to these instructions is highly recommended for a smooth and uniform development experience accross the team (and 3rd parties, too).

## Requirements

- MacOS or Linux
- Git
- Docker
  - Any fairly recent version should work. Originally developed with Docker Engine v24.
- Node.js and NPM
  - For just running Storybook locally, any version will do as the containers will internally use correct versions anyway. If you plan to do anything else, using the version specified in `.nvmrc` is highly recommended (`v20.19.0` at the time of writing this doc).
  - In general, using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and setting your terminal to automatically switch Node.js versions based on `.nvmrc` files is highly recommended.
- IDE with robust support for TypeScript
  - We prefer VS Code and offer a settings template to get going immediately (see [VS Code Setup Instructions](/docs/documentation-development-tooling-setup-vs-code--documentation)).

## Set Up Local Repository

Clone the upstream repository to your machine (requires write access).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/funidata/fudis.git
```

If you do not have write access and are not working for Funidata, you need to first fork our repository to your own account and use that for development.

## Install NPM Packages

```bash
npm ci
```

## Run Development Environment

Make sure Docker daemon is running. First startup takes a while as Docker fetches and builds necessary images. Once complete, Storybook is accessible at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

```bash
npm start
```

Once you are done, shutdown the development environment with `npm stop`. You can use `docker ps` to verify all containers are down (and to check their status if something is not working).

See [Command Reference Documentation](/docs/documentation-development-tooling-command-reference--documentation) for more information and complete command reference.
