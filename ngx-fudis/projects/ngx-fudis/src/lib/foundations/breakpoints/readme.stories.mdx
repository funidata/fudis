# Breakpoint mixins

Load Fudis mixins and tokens to your file in your SCSS file with:

```
@use "@funidata/ngx-fudis" as fudis;
```

## Min-width mixin

The mixins are using min-width, so when you are using the mixin **breakpoint('m')**, your styles will be applied from the medium breakpoint and up.

```
@include fudis.breakpoint($breakpoint){}
```

| $breakpoint                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------- |
| string value from breakpoint tokens map (_$breakpoints_) |

```
.my-element {
  @include fudis.breakpoint('m'){
    // Rules defined here apply from breakpoint 'm' and up
  };
}

```

## Max-width mixin

The mixins are using max-width, so when you are using the mixin **breakpoint-max('m')**, your styles will be applied if viewport is small than M size.

```
@include fudis.breakpoint-max($breakpoint){}
```

# Breakpoint tokens and values they apply

Breakpoints are based on Bootstrap's breakpoint system, which Sisu application uses widely.
