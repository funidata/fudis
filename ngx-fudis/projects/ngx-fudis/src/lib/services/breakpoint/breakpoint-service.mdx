# Breakpoint Service

Breakpoint Service is used by [Grid Component](/docs/components-grid-grid--documentation) in adding responsive CSS styling in various breakpoints.

## How to Use

Breakpoint Service uses Angular Material [BreakpointObserver](https://v6.material.angular.io/cdk/layout/overview) in detecting application media widths.

### getBreakpointState()

`FudisBreakpointService.getBreakpointState()` returns BreakpointState object, with booleans for all currently matching breakpoints.

```

interface BreakpointState = {
    /** Whether the breakpoint is currently matching. */
      matches: true,

    /**
     * A key boolean pair for each query provided to the observe method,
     * with its current matched state.
     */
      breakpoints: {
        '(min-width: 100em)': false,
        '(min-width: 75em)': false,
        '(min-width: 62em)': false,
        '(min-width: 48em)': false,
        '(min-width: 36em)': false,
        '(min-width: 0)': true,
      },
    };

```
