# Link Directive

Link Directive adjusts styles and HTML attributes of any native anchor element with tag `<a>`. The directive allows application to use its own routing solutions, as Link Directive does not take any opinion in this. It only tweaks styling of binded anchor element.

## Usage Guidelines

To bind anchor element with Link Directive, include `fudisLink` directive selector to it. Directive also requires `title` string property. If your anchor element directs to an external site, add `external` boolean property to it. This will adjust HTML attributes and semantics including a 'new-tab' [Icon Component](/docs/components-icon--documentation).

<Source
  code={`
<a fudisLink href="https://www.example.com" [title]="'This is external link'" [external]="true"></a>
`}
/>

**Note!**

Although inserting text content between `<a></a>` tags can be done, it is highly recommended only to use `title` property for the text content of the link. With `title` property we can be sure, that only `string` type text is used and Angular change detection can be triggered more reliably with the `title` property.

## Example

<Canvas of={LinkDirectiveStories.Example} />

## Accessibility

- Link has visible focus
- When Link Directive is set external, an icon indicates new tab for visible users but is hidden from screen readers
- When Link Directive is set external, aria-label has an additional info text about this
- When Link Directive is set external, HTML attributes `rel` and `target` are set properly
