# Link Directive

Link Directive adjusts styles and HTML attributes of any native anchor element with tag `<a>`. The directive allows application to use its own routing solutions, as Link Directive does not take any opinion in this. It only tweaks styling of selected anchor element.

## Usage Guidelines

To bind anchor element with Link Directive, add `fudisLink` selector to it. Directive also requires `title` string property. If your anchor element directs to an external site, add `external` property to it. This will adjust HTML attributes and render an icon indicating, that this link will open a new tab.

**Note!**

Although inserting text content between `<a></a>` tags is allowed, it is recommended only to use `title` property for the text content of the link. This is because Angular change detection can be triggered more reliably with the `title` property.

`<a fudisLink href="https://www.example.com" [title]="'This is external link'" [external]="true"></a>`

## Examples

<Canvas of={LinkDirectiveStories.Example}></Canvas>

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={LinkDirective} />

## Accessibility

- Link has visible focus
- When Link Directive is set external, an Icon indicates new tab for visible users but is hidden from screen readers
- When Link Directive is set external, screenreader is informed that link will open in a new tab
