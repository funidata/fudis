# Link Directive

Link Directive provides the same look and feel as [Link Component](/docs/components-link--documentation).

## Usage Guidelines

When routing method such as [UI-Router](https://ui-router.github.io/ng2/) is required, use `fudisLink` directive with HTML anchor element.
This will apply Link Component's `size` property to the native HTML anchor element.
At the moment, Link Directive doesn't support the use of `externalLink` nor `title` properties.

## Examples

<Canvas of={LinkDirectiveStories.Example}></Canvas>

```
    <a fudisLink [uiSref]="route" [size]="size">https://www.example.com</a>
```

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={LinkDirective} />

# Link

Link Component is an HTML anchor element which uses [Link Directive](/docs/directives-link--documentation).
Link Directive can also be used as is and is recommended when using e.g. [UI-Router](https://ui-router.github.io/ng2/).

## Usage Guidelines

Link Component **requires** its link reference.
Possible values are `href` for regular HTML href or `externalLink` which targets to another domain, this will also add new-tab icon and assistive aria-label for screen readers.
Or if using [Angular Router](https://angular.io/api/router) the required properties are `link` and `fragmentId`.

Link URL is set as the link title by default. By adding `title` property the visible title can be modified.

## Example

### Accessibility

- Link has visible focus
- Icon indicates new tab for visible users but is hidden from screen readers
- Screenreader is informed if link will open in a new tab
