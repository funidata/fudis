# Link Directive

Link Directive provides the same look and feel as [Link Component](/docs/components-link--documentation).

## Usage Guidelines

When routing method such as [UI-Router](https://ui-router.github.io/ng2/) is required, use `fudisLink` directive with HTML anchor element.
This will apply Link Component's `size` property to the native HTML anchor element.
At the moment, Link Directive doesn't support the use of `externalLink` nor `title` properties.

## Examples

<Canvas of={LinkDirectiveStories.Example}></Canvas>

```
    <a fudisLink [uiSref]="route" [size]="size">https://www.example.com</a>
```

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={LinkDirective} exclude={linkExclude} />
