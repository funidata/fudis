# Spacing

Spacing directive allows you to add responsive margin attributes for desired components. Allowed inputs are same as [Spacing tokens](/docs/foundations-spacing--documentation) from `xxs` to `xxl`. Default value is always `0`.

## Usage Guidelines

Spacing directive works similarly as when applying `columns` to [Grid directive](/docs/components-grid-grid--documentation). It can either be assigned as single static value for all breakpoints or as an object to define different margin for different breakpoints.

### Allowed Attributes

Spacing directive can take in four Input values: `marginTop`, `marginBottom`, `marginRight` and `marginLeft`. These are separate Inputs and `margin` shorthand is not yet available.

Below is **non-responsive** example. The same margin-top value will be applied throughout all screen sizes.

```
<fudis-button fudisSpacing [marginTop]="'md'" />
```

Below is **responsive** example. Margin-top and margin-left will be adjusted to given breakpoints. More information on breakpoints, see [Breakpoints](/docs/foundations-breakpoints--documentation) documentation.

```
<fudis-button
	fudisSpacing
	[marginTop]={sm: 'xs', md: 'lg', xxl: 'xxl'}
	[marginLeft]={sm: 'xxs', lg: 'xl'} />
```
