# Grid & Grid Item Directives

Grid and Grid Item Directives enable Grid layout properties to elements and components. Fudis also provide [Grid and Grid Item wrapper components](/docs/components-grid--documentation), which already implement these directives.

In component documentations are more throughout examples, guidelines etc. but same principles apply to any other element which has Grid or Grid Item Directive binded to.
