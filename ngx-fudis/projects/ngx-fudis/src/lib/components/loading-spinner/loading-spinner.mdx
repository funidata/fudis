# Loading Spinner Component

Loading Spinner Component is used to communicate about delayed application loading state of the full page, or part of the viewed page.

Components consists of:

- Icon SVG
- Customisable Label text, where Fudis will provide default 'Loading' text for English, Finnish and Swedish.

## Example

<Canvas of={LoadingSpinnerStories.Example} />

## Usage Guidelines

Application should determine case by case, if use of Loading Spinner would make sense.

### General Guidelines

- Loading Spinner is displayed, if loading takes longer than 2 seconds
- When loading is in progress, user focus should not be automatically moved to loadable section during loading

### Section or part of the page

- Use smaller `variant` of `sm`
- If user focus is in the Loading Spinner, focus should moved to the first element meaningful element after loading is finished

### Full page

- Use larger `variant` of `lg`
- After loading is finished, user focus should be as initially after page load, e. g. in the `h1` title element
- Component communicates loading status for screen reader users with ARIA attributes. With variant `lg` Fudis automatically communicates status messages 'Page is loading' and 'Page load finished'. This can be overriden by app using `statusMessage` property.
