# Loading Spinner Component

Loading Spinner Component is used to communicate about delayed application loading state of the full page, or part of the viewed page.

Component consists of:

- Icon SVG
- Customisable label text, where Fudis will provide default '_Loading_' text for English, Finnish and Swedish.

## Usage Guidelines

Application should determine case by case, if use of Loading Spinner would make sense.

### General Guidelines

- Loading Spinner should be displayed, if loading takes longer than 2 seconds.
- When loading is in progress, user focus should not be automatically moved to loadable section during loading.
- Component has default '_Loading_' text provided, which can be overriden through `label` input property.

### Section or Other Smaller Part of the Page

- Use smaller `variant` of `sm`.
- Necessary margins can be added through Core Spacing helper classes
- If user focus is in the Loading Spinner, focus should be moved to the first meaningful element after loading is finished.

### Full Page

- **IMPORTANT**: Instead of using `<fudis-loading-spinner *ngIf="appLoading"/>` use `<fudis-loading-spinner [visible]="appLoading"/>`. This will help screen reader users, as component exists in DOM although it is not visually visible.
- Use larger `variant` of `lg`
- Component communicates its loading status for screen reader. With variant `lg` component automatically communicates status messages '_Page is loading_' and '_Page load finished_'. This can be overriden by app using `statusMessage` property.
- After loading is finished, user focus should be where initially intended after page load, e. g. in the `h1` title element. If focus is manually changed by the Application, there should be small delay before focus, so that screen reader has time to announce '_Page load finished_' status.
- For code example, check repository's `StorybookExampleLoadingSpinnerComponent` example, seen below as well. Located `./ngx-fudis/projects/ngx-fudis/src/lib/components/loading-spinner/examples`.

### Code Example

<Source
  code={`
<fudis-loading-spinner
  [variant]="'lg'" // default 'sm'
  [label]="'Page loading is in progress'" // Overrides default value
  [statusRole]="'Screen reader can see this message'" // Overrides default value
  [visible]="true" // Set this false, when loading is finished
/>`}
/>

## Design Guidelines

### Common

- SVG fill color: primary (e.g. Sisu #1076DB)
- Component max width: 256px

### Variant `sm`

- Label text: Body Text regular md
- Margin top: 24px
- Horizontally centered

### Variant `lg`

- Icon size: 48px \* 48px
- Label text: Body Text regular lg
