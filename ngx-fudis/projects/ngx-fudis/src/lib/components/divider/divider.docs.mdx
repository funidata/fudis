# Divider

Fudis Divider is a horizontal rule that implies a thematic break between HTML paragraph-level elements.

## Usage Guidelines

Use `<fudis-divider />` on your template when you need to visually separate page content. Note that the Divider is hidden
from screen readers, so for semantic division accessible to screen readers you need to use a semantic wrapper like
[Fudis Section](/docs/components-section--documentation).

## Examples

<Canvas of={DividerStories.Example}></Canvas>

## Accessibility

- Color contrast meets WCAG AA minimum contrast ratio against white `#FFFFFF` background
  - Contrast ratio 4.81:1
  - **NOTE**: When using divider on backgrounds other than white, make sure the color contrast is adequate
- As a purely visual element, Divider is hidden from screen readers
