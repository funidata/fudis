# Notification

Notifications are often informative contextual notifications that cannot be clicked away. Input property `variant` can have following values:

- Yellow `warning` notification is used in notes
- Red `danger` notification describes an error situation
- Green `success` indicates the possibility or success of some function
- Blue `info`, on the other hand, is a neutral guideline

## Examples

<Canvas of={NotificationStories.AllVariants}></Canvas>

### Content Guidelines

For basic text content it is recommended to use [Body Text Components](/docs/components-typography-body-text--documentation),
however Notification Component can contain any kind of Fudis components, text or html content if needed.

If using [Button Component](/docs/components-button--documentation) or button element they will be transformed to look like
[Link Component](/docs/components-link--documentation). Otherwise Notification does not interfere with the content styling.

Please see code examples for recommended usage patterns.

<Canvas of={NotificationStories.ExampleWithMultipleChildComponents}></Canvas>

<Canvas of={NotificationStories.ExampleWithExternalLinkAndButton}></Canvas>

### Accessibility

- Notification background and text color contrast ratio meets AA and AAA levels.
- Notification content is accessible by screen readers.
- External link is communicated to screen reader with assistive aria-label.
