# Notification

Notifications are often informative contextual notifications that cannot be clicked away. Input property `variant` can have following values:

- Yellow `warning` notification is used in notes
- Red `danger` notification describes an error situation
- Green `success` indicates the possibility or success of some function
- Blue `info`, on the other hand, is a neutral guideline

## Examples

<Canvas of={NotificationStories.AllVariants} />

### Content Guidelines

For basic text content it is recommended to use [Body Text Components](/docs/components-typography-body-text--documentation),
however Notification Component can contain any kind of Fudis components, text or html content if needed.

If using [Button Component](/docs/components-button--documentation) or button element they will be transformed to look like
[Link Component](/docs/components-link--documentation). Otherwise Notification does not interfere with the content styling.

There is also the possibility to add a more detailed description of the Notification for screen readers. When HTML element is described by another element, it must be linked using the other element's id.
Add `ariaDescribedby` input, using the id of the linked content. See the example implementation in the Notification with Button code.

Please see code examples for recommended usage patterns.
