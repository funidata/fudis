# Language Badge Group Component

Language Badge Group is a language selector component designed to use with specific translatable text and string input elements.
The component helps to change the selected translation and notes if the content has missing translation in any selectable language.

## Usage Guidelines

By default Language Badge Group always display Badges for Finnish, Swedish and English in this order.
To define different config to Application's Language Badges, use `FudisTranslationService` function `setSelectableLanguages()` to define a new config.
Check documentation at [FudisTranslationService](/docs/services-translation--documentation#translation-service).

### Properties

Language badge group has one mandatory input property `translatedLanguages` with `FudisLanguageAbbr[]` type.
The property is a list that tells for which of the selectable languages translations are provided for.

### Handling changes

Language badge group has `handleClick` output property. When clicking the language badge, the property handleClick will emit a selected language string.

## Examples

### Basic example

<Canvas of={LanguageBadgeGroupStories.Example} />

### Interactive example along with app language and badge language options change

If the current app language is among the selectable and provided languages, it will be selected as a default.
Otherwise the first selectable language with provided translation will be the default selected.

<Canvas of={LanguageBadgeGroupStories.WithInteractiveContent} />

### Accessibility concern

If parts of the text are changed to another language, it is important to address this to assistive technology so that they can correctly pronounce foreign language.
When Language Badge Group is combined with [Body Text](/docs/components-typography-body-text--documentation) component, use body text's `lang` attribute to define parts of text in a different language.

### Accessibility

- Language badge has visible focus state
- Badge group can be navigated with keyboard tab key
- Badge click can be triggered with keyboard enter and space key
- Each badge has an aria-label informing the full language name and possible missing and selected states
- Lang attribute is used with parts of text that are in a different language
