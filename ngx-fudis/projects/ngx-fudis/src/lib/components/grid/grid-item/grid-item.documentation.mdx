# Grid Item

Grid Item Component is a wrapper component which implements automatically the features of the [Grid Item Directive](/docs/directives-grid-grid-item--documentation).

Grid Item is meant to be used as first level child component under [Grid Component](/docs/components-grid-grid--documentation).

By default, all first level child Grid Items behave exactly in a way their parent has been configured.

Using this Grid Item Component or Directive, you can define individual alignment behavior for each Grid Item.

## Horizontal and Vertical Alignment

Grid Item has properties of `alignSelfX` for horizontal and `alignSelfY` for vertical alignment which makes the Grid Item aling itself inside its container boundaries.

```
<fudis-grid [alignItemsX]="'center'">
  <fudis-grid-item>This item is centered by its parent</fudis-grid-item>
  <fudis-grid-item>This item is centered by its parent</fudis-grid-item>
  <fudis-grid-item [alignSelfX]="'end'">This item overrides parent's configs
  and aligns itself differently</fudis-grid-item>
<fudis-grid>
```

### Example of `alignSelfX`

<Canvas of={GridItemStories.AlignSelfX}></Canvas>

### Example of `alignSelfY`

<Canvas of={GridItemStories.AlignSelfY}></Canvas>

## Defining Columns Expansion and Position

When defining the parent Grid Component's `columns` property, by default all Grid Items follow that spesified rule. The same `columns` property is available to a single Grid Item, which will override parent's rules. The given value is converted or used as it is to a native CSS Grid `grid-columns` attribute.

- [Native CSS Grid Column Values](#native-css-grid-column-values)
- [Responsive Columns For Each Breakpoint](#responsive-columns-for-each-breakpoint)

### Setting Grid Item To Stretch Whole Width

Fudis Grid Item has a shorthand `[columns]="'stretch'"`for making a Grid Item stretch the whole horizontal width of Grid container.

### Using A Number Value For Columns

When `columns` value is a number, e. g. `[columns]="2`, it will be converted to CSS `grid-columns` attribute value of string `span 2` meaning Grid Item will span across two columns from the point it starts.

### Native CSS Grid Column Values

The values Grid Item's `columns` can be the same as native CSS Grid item's `grid-column` property. By default the value is `auto`.

Quoting from [MDN's grid-column page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column):

> The `grid-column` CSS shorthand property specifies a grid item's size and location within a grid column by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the inline-start and inline-end edge of its grid area.

### Example of Columns

<Canvas of={GridItemStories.Columns}></Canvas>

### Responsive Columns For Each Breakpoint

As with Grid Component, Grid Item's `columns` value can be an object, where behavior in each breakpoint can be defined.

### Example of Responsive Columns

<Canvas of={GridItemStories.ResponsiveColumns}></Canvas>
