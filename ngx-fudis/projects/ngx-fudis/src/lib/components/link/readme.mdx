# Link

Link Component is an HTML anchor element which uses [Link Directive](/docs/directives-link--documentation).
Link Directive can also be used as is and is recommended when using e.g. [UI-Router](https://ui-router.github.io/ng2/).

## Usage Guidelines

Link Component **requires** its link reference.
Possible values are `href` for regular HTML href or `externalLink` which targets to another domain, this will also add new-tab icon and assistive aria-label for screen readers.
Or if using [Angular Router](https://angular.io/api/router) the required properties are `link` and `fragmentId`.

Link URL is set as the link title by default. By adding `title` property the visible title can be modified.

Link color can be adjusted between `primary-dark` (default), `gray-dark` and `white`. Use `gray-dark` and `white` with caution.

## Example

<Canvas of={LinkStories.Example}></Canvas>
