# Button

Interactive Button Component can be used whenever there is need for user to perform some clickable action, e. g. to submit a form.

## Commonly used Properties

### Label (mandatory)

Button has a visible label that is the only required input attribute.

### Variant

Buttons are categorized based on their importance and functionality. It is **important** to use the correct variant of the button for the intended action and not to overuse them to avoid overwhelming the user.

Button has three variants: `primary` (default), `secondary` and `tertiary`.

### Type

Type has to two possible values: `button` (default) and `submit`.

For HTML semantics, if Button is a form submit button, `submit` attribute value for `type` should be used.

## Examples

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.AllVariants} />

### Button with Icon

Button has option for displaying Icon component alongside the label. Icon color is automatically set according to which button variant is in use.
For situations where only visible icon is preferred, use [IconButton](/docs/components-iconbutton--documentation) instead.

Icon is only a visual indicator and is always hidden from screen readers.

Icon can be configured with `icon` and `iconRotate` properties.
