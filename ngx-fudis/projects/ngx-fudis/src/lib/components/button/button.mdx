# Button

Interactive Button Component can be used whenever there is need for user to perform some clickable action, e. g. to submit a form.

## Commonly used Properties

### Label (mandatory)

Text label is the only required input attribute Button requires. Depending on other input attributes, the label is rendered either as a visually visible text or as visually hidden aria-label attribute.

### Variant

Buttons are categorized based on their importance and functionality. It is **important** to use the correct variant of the button for the intended action and not to overuse them to avoid overwhelming the user.

Button has three variants: `primary` (default), `secondary` and `tertiary`.

### Type

Type has to two possible values: `button` (default) and `submit`.

For HTML semantics, if Button is a form submit button, `submit` attribute value for `type` should be used.

## Examples

### Button with Icon

Button has option for displaying Icon component alongside the label. Frequently used icons: <code>search</code>, <code>three-dots</code> and <code>delete</code>. Icon color is automatically set according to which button variant is in use.

Icon is only a visual indicator and is always hidden from screen readers.

Icon can be configured with `icon` and `iconRotate` properties.
