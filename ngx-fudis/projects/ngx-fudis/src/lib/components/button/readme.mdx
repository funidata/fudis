# Button

Buttons are categorized based on their importance and functionality, i.e `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary`.
It is important to use the correct variant of the button for the intended action and not to overuse them to avoid overwhelming the user.

There are three button sizes available: `medium`, `small` and `icon-only`.

## Examples

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.AllVariants}></Canvas>

### Button with icon

Button has option for icon. Frequently used icons: <code>search</code>, <code>three-dots</code> and <code>delete</code>. Icon color is automatically set according to which button variant is in use.

Icon is only a visual indicator and is always hidden from screen readers.

### Button with icon only

Button can be without a visible label but use this variation sparingly. To hide visible label, provide `labelHidden` property for the button component. When label is hidden, `label` property will be reflected to HTML `aria-label` attribute. This will communicate screen reader users about the button functionality.

If button has no visibile label and both `label` and `ariaLabel` are provided, those values are combined and reflected to `aria-label` HTML attribute.
