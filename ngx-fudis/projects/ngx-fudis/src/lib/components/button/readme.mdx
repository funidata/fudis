# Button

Buttons are categorized based on their importance and functionality, i.e `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary`.
It is important to use the correct variant of the button for the intended action and not to overuse them to avoid overwhelming the user.

There are two button sizes available: `medium` and `small`.

## Examples

<Canvas>
	<Story id="components-button--all-variants"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Button with icon

Button has option for icon. Frequently used icons: <code>search</code>, <code>three-dots</code> and <code>delete</code>. Icon color is automatically set according to which button variant is in use.

Icon is only a visual indicator and is always hidden from screen readers.

	<Story id="components-button--icon-button"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Button with icon only

Button can be without label but use this variation sparingly. If the button does not have a label, always remember to add descriptive aria-label in order to communicate screen reader users about the button functionality.
