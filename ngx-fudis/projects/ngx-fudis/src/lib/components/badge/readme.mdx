# Badge

Badge is a colored text element. It is used to indicate a certain state of a process or to highlight some information.

Badge has five variants which determines the color: `accent`, `danger`, `primary`, `secondary` and `success`.

## Usage Guidelines

Text for the badge can be passed through `content` Input or by content projection. The content should be **clear and concise**, bearing in mind that screen readers do not get any additional information about the badge but only the text content it has.

Badge stretches with its content, but other than that it does not have any size options. Font-size and paddings are fixed.

## Examples

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.AllVariants} />

## Accessibility

- Color contrast inside different badge colors meets WCAG AA minimum contrast ratio
  - **NOTE**: When using badges on backgrounds other than white, make sure the color contrast is adequate
- Screen readers do not get any addtional information about badge color, text is read as is
