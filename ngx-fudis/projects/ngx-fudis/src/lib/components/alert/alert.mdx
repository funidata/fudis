# Alert Group

**Please note, that Alert Group is not compatible with Sisu alert logic.**

Alert Group Component displays list of toaster-like Alert Components with four variants: `success`, `info`, `warning` and `danger.` These variants are the same ones as with [Notification Component](/docs/components-notification--documentation).

## Usage Guidelines

First, add `<fudis-alert-group />` HTML tag in the application template, preferably as the bottom element in `app.component.html`.
Note that Alerts will position themselves at the very top of their container, meaning they might overlap the application navigation element, which should be fixed manually by setting custom CSS `top` value as needed in the application side.
Also, make sure that the custom CSS does not affect Alerts in Dialogs, where they should always be on top because Dialogs have backdrop.

## Adding and Dismissing Alerts

Alert Group listens to `FudisAlertService` where application or UI sends information about adding or dismissing alerts.

### Add New Alert

To add new alert, send an object of type `FudisAlert` to `FudisAlertService` using `addAlert()`.

Note that `id` doesn't need to be unique for AlertService.

<Source
  code={`
constructor(
	private _alertService: FudisAlertService
	) {
		const newAlert: FudisAlert = {
			message: 'Well done, a new alert is displayed!',
			type: 'success',
			id: 'well-done-identifier',
		};

    	_alertService.addAlert(newAlert);
    }

`}
/>

### Dismiss Alert

#### Dismiss By Id

Previously sent alert can be dismissed with `dismissAlert()`. If multiple alerts with the same `id` is sent, all of them will be dismissed.

<Source
  code={`
_alertService.dismissAlert('well-done-identifier');
`}
/>

#### Dismiss All

All alerts can be dismissed by calling `dismissAll()`.

<Source
  code={`
_alertService.dismissAll();
`}
/>

#### Dismiss From UI

When user clicks alert's close button, it will dismiss that single alert from the service. But it will not affect the other alerts with the same `id`.

## Positioning

Usually Alert Group is positioned to the top of the screen, right after navigation.

CSS position of Alert Group can be set using `position` attribute with three currently provided options. By default it is `fixed` but can be set to `static` or `absolute` as well.

## With Fudis Dialog

Fudis automatically embeddes Alert Group inside [Dialog Component](/docs/components-dialog--documentation), so that new and existing alerts are visible and available for keyboard users when dialog is open.
Alerts are reloaded to the DOM each time dialog is opened and closed.

## Accessibility and Keyboard Behavior

### Alert Variants

All Alerts are communicated to screen readers when appearing for the first time, but with different roles. `danger` and `warning` variants have html attribute of `role='alert'`, other variants have `role='status'`. Focus does not change even if new alert appears.

### Closing Alert

When user closes an alert, focus will move automatically to the last alert in the list. If there are no alerts left, Alert Group tries to return focus to that UI element where focus was before focusing on the alert.

### With Fudis Dialog Open

[Dialog Component](/docs/components-dialog--documentation) has a focus trap, and navigating outside of the dialog is not possible until the dialog is closed. If there are visible alerts, those are included as focusable elements inside the dialog's focus trap. If user closes all the alerts when dialog is open, focus returns to dialog's close button.

### Other Mentionable Accessibility Details

- Danger and warning alerts will interrupt the user's current activity
- Alert Group is wrapped inside a `section` element which has an automatic `aria-label` describing its content, e.g. _'Notifications - Number of notifications: 5'_
