# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is essentially a navigation element.

## Usage Guidelines

Breadcrumbs organism is built using parent wrapper of Breadcrumbs Component and adding Breadcrumbs Item Components as its children.

### Breadcrumbs - Parent Component

Necessary properties for Breadcrumbs Component is `label`.

`label` is used as aria-label and it should describe the name of the section breadcrumbs consists from, e.g. _"My profile"_. Aria-label will automatically have a prefix _"Breadcrumbs: "_ which will be followed by the given label.

### Breadcrumbs Item - Child Component

Breadcrumbs Item has content slots for `<a>` and `<fudis-body-text>` elements. Existing array of link objects with `label` and `url` properties should be looped through with index. See the code example in the example below.
[BodyText](/docs/components-typography-body-text--documentation) is meant to be rendered for the last link, so it is presented as plain text. It will automatically have `aria-current="page"`.

## Example

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.Example}></Canvas>
