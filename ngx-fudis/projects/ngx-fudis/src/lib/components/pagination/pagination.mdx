# Pagination

Pagination is a navigation element that can be used on pages or elements. It provides controls for switching content across multiple pages.
Use Pagination only for content which structure does not change between pages eg. tables and lists.

## Example

<Canvas of={PaginationStories.Example} />

## Usage Guidelines

```
<fudis-pagination
  [pageCount]="20"
  [pageIndex]="0"
  [pageHref]="(i) => '/products?page=' + (i + 1)"
  [paginationAriaLabel]="'Example navigation'"
  (pageChange)="onPageChange($event)">
</fudis-pagination>

```

### Properties

Pagination requires `pageCount` in order to generate total amount of pages. Additionally current `pageIndex` can be provided, the first page starts with index 0. Pagination has also a mandatory
`paginationAriaLabel` for differentiating it from other site navigational elements. `pageHref` input takes in a function that receives the zero-based page index and returns the URL string for the page link.

### Accessibility

- Pagination has `aria-live:"polite"` announcement for informing when page have been changed.
- Aria-labels are used for describing current, previous and next page number.
- Keyboard navigation:
  - `Tab`/ `Shift` move focus between pagination links.
  - `Enter` is usaed for selecting key.
  - Focus is preserved on the active element after a page change.

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={PaginationComponent} exclude={paginationExclude} />
