# Autocomplete (single-select)

Fudis-autocomplete (single-select) is based on Angular Material Autocomplete.

Autocomplete is a search input providing user with a list of suggestions. There are two variants for single-select autocomplete: `search` and `dropdown`.

**Search** variant is expecting user input and the option filtering is triggered after three characters. **Dropdown** variant will display options in a dropdown when input is focused, options can be filtered by typing. Filtering is triggered from the first character.

Autocomplete (single-select) can only have one option selected at a time.

## Examples

<Canvas of={AutocompleteStories.AutocompleteSearch}></Canvas>
<Canvas of={AutocompleteStories.AutocompleteDropdown}></Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

Autocomplete is designed to use when basic [dropdown](/story/components-form-dropdown--single-select) is not enough - that is, cases where option list has too many objects to scroll through and user has an idea what they are searching for.

**NOTE:** Autocomplete does not have any lazy loading at this time, all the data is loaded in the DOM when component is initialized. This can cause performance issues with `dropdown` variant if option list data is massive. Lazy loading will be implemented later on.

### Mandatory Properties

Autocomplete requires at least `label` and `options` object array with possible option values.

Options array takes in objects with the following signature:

```
{
	/** Underlying value of the option */
	value: any;
	/** Value that is shown in the UI */
	label: string;
	/** Is option disabled in the options list dropdown */
	disabled?: boolean;
	/** To store additional data */
	[key: string]: any;
}
```

### Validators and Error Handling

Fudis form components use Fudis Validators. See the full documentation on [how to use Fudis Validators](/docs/utilities-validators--documentation).

If a custom validation is used, read [how to add Error message](/docs/components-form-error-message--documentation).

**Autocomplete validators**

- required

## Accessibility

- Label and guidance are linked to the input via id
- Input can be disabled
  - Input remains focusable with keyboard and screen reader
  - Disabled state is communicated for screen reader
- Options can be disabled
  - Disabled option is focusable with screen reader
  - Disabled state is communicated for screen reader
- **NOTE:** Option list selection can only be made with `enter` and not with `space` since it is considered as a search character
