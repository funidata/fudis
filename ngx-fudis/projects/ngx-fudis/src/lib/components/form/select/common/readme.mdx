# Common Features of Select & Multiselect

Select and Multiselect components share multiple common features which are inherited from internal non-public `SelectBaseDirective` and `InputBaseDirective` directives.

Most notable common API feature is grouping options and choosing if component is either a regular dropdown or an autocomplete component filtering dropdown options according to user's text input.

## Basic Form Component Attributes

### Label (Mandatory)

Label string describing selection to be made from the select dropdown options.

### Help Text

Additional help text string to provide additional description or instructions what user is expected to choose from the select's options.

### Size

Width of the component. Value can be string `lg`, `md` or `sm`. By default size is `lg`.

### Placeholder

Placeholder string text shown in the component, when it has no chosen value.

### Selection Update

Select and Multiselect Component provides `@Output` event emitter `selectionUpdate` for cases if application needs to do something special if the form control value changes. Output of the event emitter in Select is either `null` or `FudisSelectOption` and for Multiselect `null` or an array `FudisSelectOption<object>[]`.

```
// TypeScript

mySelectionUpdate(option: null | FudisSelectOption):void {
  console.log(option)
}

// HTML Template

<fudis-select (selectionUpdate)="mySelectionUpdate($event)">
  ...
</fudis-select>

```

### Usage Example

Example using Select component, but same input attributes work as well with Multiselect Component using `<fudis-multiselect>` selector.

```
<fudis-select
  [label]="'Your favorite day of the week'"
  [helpText]="'Choose one of the seven available options.'"
  [size]="'md'"
  [placeholder]="'Your favorite day'"
>
...
</fudis-select>
```

### Validators and Error Handling

It is recommended to use Fudis Validators with Fudis form components. See the full documentation on [how to use Fudis Validators](/docs/utilities-validators--documentation).

If a custom validation is required, read [how to add Error message](/docs/components-form-error-message--documentation).

## Autocomplete Features

### Autocomplete Boolean

When `autocomplete` is set to `true`, the input field of the component changes to a text input, where user can start typing. Dropdown list of options is filtered and only shows visible those options, where filter text is included in option's label.

### Autocomplete Clear Button Boolean

By default `autocompleteClearButton` is set to boolean `true`. When `true`, autocomplete input will display a close icon button. This button is used to clear and empty the filter text string in the input. With Select Component this clear button will also set Form Control's value to `null`.

When `autocompleteClearButton` is set to `false`, the select with autocomplete works very similarly as select without autocomplete: dropdown options will instantly open up when user clicks or focuses to the input.

### Example Usage

```
<fudis-select
  [autocomplete]="true"
  [autocompleteClearButton]="false"
  ...
>
...
</fudis-select>
```

### Example Select with Autocomplete

<Canvas of={Stories.SelectAutocomplete}></Canvas>

### Example Multiselect with Autocomplete

<Canvas of={Stories.MultiselectAutocomplete}></Canvas>

## Adding Options

Documentation for including selectable options for both Select and Multiselect can be found from [Select and Multiselect Option documentation](/docs/components-form-select-select-and-multiselect-option--documentation).

## Grouping Options

Sometimes there is need to categorize and group options. Especially if list of options is long and might have options which are nearly identical but are under different sub-category.

To group options, wrap them using `SelectGroupComponent`. It has two possible HTML selectors: `fudis-select-group` and `fudis-multiselect-group`.

Select Group Component **requires** `label` string property.

```
<fudis-select>
  <ng-template fudisContent [type]="'select-options'">
    <fudis-select-group [label]="'First Group'">
      <fudis-select-option />
      ... and rest of the options for the First Group
    </fudis-select-group>
    <fudis-select-group [label]="'Last Group'">
      <fudis-select-option />
      ... and rest of the options for the Last Group
    </fudis-select-group>
  </ng-template>
</fudis-select>
```

The exactly same component can be used as well with Multiselect Component. Although the component is exactly the same as with Select Component, we recommend to use `<fudis-multiselect-group>` selector.

```
<fudis-multiselect>
  <ng-template fudisContent [type]="'select-options'">
    <fudis-multiselect-group [label]="'First Group'">
      <fudis-multiselect-option/>
      ... and rest of the options for the First Group
    </fudis-multiselect-group>
    <fudis-multiselect-group [label]="'Last Group'">
      <fudis-multiselect-option/>
      ... and rest of the options for the Last Group
    </fudis-multiselect-group>
  </ng-template>
</fudis-multiselect>
```
