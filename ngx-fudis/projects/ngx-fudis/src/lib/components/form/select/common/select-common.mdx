# Common Features of Select & Multiselect

Select and Multiselect components share multiple common features.

Most notable common API feature is grouping options and choosing if component is either a regular dropdown or an autocomplete component filtering dropdown options according to user's text input.

- [Variants with Autocomplete Features](#variants-with-autocomplete-features)
- [Adding Options](#adding-options)
- [Grouping Options](#grouping-options)

## Basic Form Component Attributes

### Label (Mandatory)

Input label, describing selection to be made from the select dropdown options.

### Help Text

Additional help text to provide description or instructions what user is expected to choose from the select's options.

### Size

Width of the component. Accepted values are `lg`, `md` or `sm`. By default the size is `lg`.

### Placeholder

Placeholder text shown in the component, when it has no chosen value.

### Popover

Popover can be included with properties from [Popover Directive](/docs/directives-popover--documentation). It also requires an additional `popoverTriggerLabel` for the button that triggers the popover. This label is only visible for the screen readers. The popover button contains only an icon, so it is required to inform the user what it is for, for example _"Additional information"_.

### Selection Update

Select and Multiselect Components provide `@Output` event emitter `selectionUpdate` for cases if application needs to do something special if the form control value changes. Output of the event emitter in Select is either `null` or `FudisSelectOption<T>` and for Multiselect `null` or an array `FudisSelectOption<T>[]`.

```
// TypeScript

mySelectionUpdate(option: FudisSelectOption<T> | null):void {
  console.log(option)
}

// HTML Template

<fudis-select (selectionUpdate)="mySelectionUpdate($event)">
  ...
</fudis-select>

```

### Usage Example

Example using Select component. Same input attributes work as well with Multiselect Component using `<fudis-multiselect>` selector.

```
<fudis-select
  [label]="'Your favorite day of the week'"
  [helpText]="'Choose one of the seven available options.'"
  [size]="'md'"
  [placeholder]="'Your favorite day'"
>
...
</fudis-select>
```

### Validators and Error Handling

It is recommended to use Fudis Validators with Fudis form components. See the full documentation on [how to use Fudis Validators](/docs/utilities-validators--documentation).

If a custom validation is required, read [how to add Error message](/docs/components-form-error-message--documentation).

## Variants with Autocomplete Features

Both Select and Multiselect have three variants:

- dropdown:
  - Default basic select dropdown
  - Opens on focus
  - Chevron icon is visible
- autocompleteDropdown:
  - The input field of the component changes into a text input, where user can type to filter selectable results by their visible label
  - Opens on focus
  - Chevron icon is visible
- autocompleteType
  - Similar to autocompleteDropdown
  - User must type 3 letters before any selectable results are shown
  - Initially a search icon is visible and after typing 3 letters, it changes to a button which can be used to clear the typed text

### Default Filtering Logic and Manually Filtering Options e.g. from Backend

By default, Select with Autocomplete assumes, that all available options are always loaded to the DOM and from user input it will hide or show matching options.

In real world applications there are cases, that for performance, it is unfeasible to always load all options to the DOM. Select and Multiselect has a property `autocompleteFilter`, when set to `false`, it disables default filtering logic.

This combined with Output property `filterTextUpdate` application can listen to user's input, do their own filtering logic and then load options to the DOM.

Example Stories for manual autocomplete filtering:

- [Select](/story/components-form-select-select--backend-simulation)
- [Multiselect](/story/components-form-select-multiselect--backend-simulation)

### Selection Clear Button Boolean

By default `selectionClearButton` is set to boolean `true`. Whenever user has made a valid selection from the options, the clear button can be clicked to clear the selection. This will set the component's `FormControl` to `null`.

When `selectionClearButton` is set to `false`, the clear button is not visible.

### Autocomplete Help Text

By default autocomplete variants, when user has typed anything, display a help text "Showing X results". This can be disabled by setting `autocompleteHelpText` property to boolean `false`. Or by overriding it with your own string help text.

### Example Usage

```
<fudis-select
  [variant]="autocompleteDropdown"
  [autocompleteHelpText]="'Hello from autocompleteHelpText'"
  [selectionClearButton]="false"
  ...
>
...
</fudis-select>
```

### Example Select with Autocomplete Dropdown

<Canvas of={Stories.SelectAutocomplete} />

### Example Multiselect with Autocomplete Dropdown

<Canvas of={Stories.MultiselectAutocomplete} />

## Adding Options

Documentation for including selectable options for both Select and Multiselect can be found from [Select and Multiselect Option documentation](/docs/components-form-select-select-and-multiselect-option--documentation).

## Grouping Options

Sometimes there is need to categorize and group options. Especially if list of options is long and might have options which are nearly identical but are under different sub-category.

To group options, wrap them using `SelectGroupComponent`. It has two possible HTML selectors: `fudis-select-group` and `fudis-multiselect-group`.

Select Group Component **requires** `label` string property.

```
<fudis-select>
  <ng-template fudisSelectOptions>
    <fudis-select-group [label]="'First Group'">
      <fudis-select-option />
      ... and rest of the options for the First Group
    </fudis-select-group>
    <fudis-select-group [label]="'Last Group'">
      <fudis-select-option />
      ... and rest of the options for the Last Group
    </fudis-select-group>
  </ng-template>
</fudis-select>
```

The exactly same component can be used as well with Multiselect Component. Although the component is exactly the same as with Select Component, we recommend to use `<fudis-multiselect-group>` selector.

```
<fudis-multiselect>
  <ng-template fudisSelectOptions>
    <fudis-multiselect-group [label]="'First Group'">
      <fudis-multiselect-option/>
      ... and rest of the options for the First Group
    </fudis-multiselect-group>
    <fudis-multiselect-group [label]="'Last Group'">
      <fudis-multiselect-option/>
      ... and rest of the options for the Last Group
    </fudis-multiselect-group>
  </ng-template>
</fudis-multiselect>
```

### Example Select Dropdown with Grouping

### Example Multiselect Dropdown with Grouping
