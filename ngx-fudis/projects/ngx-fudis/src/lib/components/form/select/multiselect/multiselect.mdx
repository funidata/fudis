# Multiselect

Multiselect Component is a form component displaying a dropdown list of selectable options to choose one or multiple values.

## Properties

### Common Properties and Features

Multiselect Component shares multiple common features with Select Component, such as labels, popover, autocompletion and grouping of options.

Therefore please check also [Common Features](/docs/components-form-select-common-features--documentation) documentation.

### Form Control

Multiselect Component requires Angular Form Control. Type and value of control can be either `null` or `FudisSelectOption<T>[]` array consisting of options.

```
// TypeScript

defaultOptions: FudisSelectOption<string>[] = [{value: 'default-option-id', label: 'Default Option'}]

myControl: new FormControl<FudisSelectOption<string>[] | null>(defaultOptions)

// HTML Template

<fudis-multiselect [control]="myControl">
  ...
</fudis-multiselect>

```

### Show Selection Chips

By default, Multiselect Component displays a list of selected options as chip buttons under the form field input. This feature is controlled by boolean `showSelectionChips`. Setting it to `false` hides the chip buttons.

> **Note!** There is accessibility concern when Selection Chips are hidden and Multiselect is used with `autocompleteType` or `autocompleteDropdown` variant. Because input field is reserved for typing, user doesn't have indicator for selected options. With these variants, the use of Selection Chips is mandatory.

## Example

<Canvas of={Stories.Example} />

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={MultiselectComponent} exclude={selectArgsTableExclude} />
