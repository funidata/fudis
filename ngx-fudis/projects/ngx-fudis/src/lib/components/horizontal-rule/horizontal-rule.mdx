# Horizontal Rule

Horizontal Rule implies a thematic break between HTML paragraph-level elements.

## Usage Guidelines

Use `<fudis-hr />` on your template when you need to visually separate page content. Note that the Horizontal Rule is
hidden from screen readers, so for semantic division accessible to screen readers you need to use a semantic wrapper
like [Section](/docs/components-section--documentation).

## Examples

<Canvas of={HorizontalRuleStories.Example} />

## Accessibility

- Color contrast meets WCAG AA minimum contrast ratio against white `#FFFFFF` background
  - Contrast ratio 4.81:1
  - **NOTE**: When using Horizontal Rule on backgrounds other than white, make sure the color contrast is adequate
- As a purely visual element, Horizontal Rule is hidden from screen readers
