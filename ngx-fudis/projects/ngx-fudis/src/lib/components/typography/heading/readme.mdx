# Heading Component

Heading Component is essentially a heading HTML element which inherits Fudis font-family.

## Usage Guidelines

### Semantic HTML Heading Level and Visible Variant

There are six heading options available from `1` to `6` and seven variant options from `xxs` to `xxl`.

The `level` input property determines which HTML element component renders. With `level=1` component renders a `h1` element and with `level=2` a `h2` element and so on.

When no `variant` input value is provided, all of the heading levels have default variants, where heading level `1` defaults to variant `xxl`, heading level `2` defaults to variant `xl` etc. However, heading variants are responsive and on mobile devices where screen size is less than [breakpoint('sm')](/docs/foundations-breakpoints--documentation#breakpoint-mixins) all of the headings are converted to a smaller heading variant.

More information about typography can be found from [Foundations/Typography](/docs/foundations-typography--documentation)

## Examples

Note! When heading `variant` is set, heading `level` does not have any effect to the variant property, i.e `level` is only essential for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Variant is opted to be modified as wanted with `variant` property as follows.

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.AllVariants} />
