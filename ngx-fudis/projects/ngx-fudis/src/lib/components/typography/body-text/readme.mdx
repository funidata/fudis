# Body Text

Body Text Component is essentially a paragraph element which inherits Fudis font-family.

There are five `variant` options available: `lg-regular`, `lg-light`, `md-regular`, `md-light` and `sm-regular`.

## Usage Guidelines

In addition to paragraph variant, Body Text can be modified through `align` property.

```
<fudis-body-text [align]="'center'" />
```

## Examples

<Canvas of={BodyTextStories.AllVariants} />

### Accessibility

- Text color `#484848` passes WCAG AAA requirement against white `#FFFFFF` background
  - Contrast ratio 9.1:1
- The `lang` attribute is used for defining language for a different parts of text that differ from the current language of the page. This helps assistive technology such as screen readers to use correct pronunciation.
