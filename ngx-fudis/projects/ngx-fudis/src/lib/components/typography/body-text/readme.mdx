# Body Text Component

Body Text Component is essentially a paragraph element which inherits Fudis font-family.

There are five `size` options available: `lg-regular`, `lg-light`, `md-regular`, `md-light` and `sm-regular`.

More information about typography can be found under [Foundations/Typography](/docs/foundations-typography--documentation)

## Usage Guidelines

In addition to paragraph size, fudis-body-text can be modified through `align` and `color` properties.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
{/* TODO: Expose this when SpacingDirective is exposed again
[Fudis spacing directive](/docs/directives-spacing--documentation) is applicable to body-text component as well. \*/}

```
<fudis-body-text
  [align]="'center'"
  [color]="'white'" />
```

## Examples

<Canvas of={BodyTextStories.AllVariants}></Canvas>
