# Section

Section is a semantic wrapper component for grouping elements. Everything within one Section should be related.

## Usage Guidelines

Section has two main areas: header and content. Inside header, addition to heading title, there can be notifications and buttons.

### Header

Each Section should be identified, therefore `title` is mandatory property which can be modified with `titleSize` and `titleLevel` properties. As in [Heading Component](/docs/components-typography-heading--documentation), size is visual and level is semantic adjustment.
Heading can also include `tooltip` with all the [Tooltip](/docs/directives-tooltip--documentation) Inputs available.

#### Notifications and Actions

Notifications and buttons are added through `fudisNotifications` and `fudisActions` directives. Both notifications and buttons have fixed positions and cannot be altered.

<Source
  code={`
  <ng-template fudisActions [type]="'section'">
  <fudis-button [label]="'Some action'"></fudis-button>
</ng-template>
<ng-template fudisNotifications [type]="'section'">
  <fudis-body-text [size]="'lg-regular'">This is notification</fudis-body-text>
</ng-template>`}
/>

### Content

The main content of the Section is added through `fudisContent` directive

<Source
  code={`<ng-template fudisContent [type]="'section'">
  <fudis-body-text>Main content of the section</fudis-body-text>
</ng-template>`}
/>

### Nesting Sections Inside Sections

Avoiding too complex page structure is recommended, but if you have a need to nest Sections inside Sections here are few guidelines and known caveats.

#### Heading Levels

Just as with any HTML content, proper heading level order is important for the accessibility. If you are nesting Sections, make sure that `titleLevel` of nested Section is lower than its parent's.

#### Actions

If you have Section inside Section, and the nested one has Actions-content but parent does not, the parent Section thinks that child's Action content should be included with the parent as well! As a workaround, include an empty Actions container with the parent as well.

<Source
  code={`
<fudis-section
  [title]="'Parent Section'"
  [titleSize]="'lg'"
  [titleLevel]="2"
  >
  // Empty Actions template, so that nested Actions will not be rendered to the parent!
  <ng-template fudisActions [type]="'section'"></ng-template>
  <ng-template fudisContent [type]="'section'">
    <fudis-section
      [title]="'Nested Section'"
      [titleSize]="'md'"
      [titleLevel]="3" >
      <ng-template fudisActions [type]="'section'">
        <fudis-button [label]="'Nested Action button'"/>
      </ng-template>
      <ng-template fudisContent [type]="'section'">
        <fudis-body-text>Main content of the section</fudis-body-text>
      </ng-template>
    </fudis-section>
  </ng-template>
</fudis-section>
  `}
/>

### Using Section With Form and Error Summary

When using Section inside [Form](/docs/components-form-form--documentation) with [Error Summary](/docs/components-form-error-summary--documentation), you can set Section title to be part of the link titles in the Error Summary by setting `errorSummaryBreadcrumb` to `true`.

**Note!** Similar `errorSummaryBreadcrumb` feature is available in [Fieldset](/docs/components-form-field-set--documentation) and [Expandable](/docs/components-expandable--documentation) components as well. If you are nesting these components, e.g. Section > Expandable > Fieldset, consider enabling breadcrumb in only one of these to avoid excessively long link texts. Usually the lowest level element is the safe choise.

## Examples

### Basic Example

<Canvas of={SectionStories.Example}></Canvas>

### Nested Example

<Canvas of={SectionStories.NestedExample}></Canvas>

## Accessibility

- Section Component uses native `<section>` element
- Section and its title is linked to its content by aria-describedby
- Section title must be provided `titleLevel` property
