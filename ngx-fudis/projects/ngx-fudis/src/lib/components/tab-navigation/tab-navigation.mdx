# Tab Navigation Component

Tab Navigation is a component that provides an easy way to navigate between different sections of your app using routes.

## Usage Guideline

The Tab Navigation consists of three components, the `TabNavigationBarComponent`, `TabNavigationTabComponent` and `TabNavigationPanelComponent`. It is meant to be used with a router of your choice. You can also use the `TabNavigationBarComponent` and `TabNavigationTabComponent` without the `TabNavigationPanelComponent` but then you have to implement some of the accessibility features yourself. More detailed information is in the Examples-section.

It has two variants, `primary` and `secondary`. Common property that is required by all three, is an unique identifier `id`.

### Tab Navigation Bar

The `TabNavigationBarComponent` component takes in the `id`, `variant`, `ariaControls` and `panel` props. The `panel` will be a reference to the `TabNavigationPanelComponent` component, that is needed by the Tab Navigation Bar to implement accessibility functionalities. If the `TabNavigationPanelComponent` is not used, `panel` prop is not needed, but then you need to declare the `ariaControls` prop, that is a reference to the element id where the tab panel content is presented.

```
<fudis-tab-navigation-bar
  [id]="'fudis-tab-navigation-1'"
  [variant]="'primary'"
  [panel]="navigationTabPanel">
  ...
</fudis-tab-navigation-bar>
```

### Tab Navigation Tab

Nested inside the `TabNavigationBarComponent` you have to add content, that are the tabs. You can choose to use `button`- or `a`-tags, mixing them is also acceptable. These require a `fudis-tab-navigation-tab` attribute and two props, `id` and `active`. **You have to provide the event handlers or/and attributes you need to implement the routing logic yourself.**

#### Button

```
<button
  fudis-tab-navigation-tab
  [id]="'some-id-here'"
  [active]="isActive"
  {{ I'm a button! }}
</button>
```

#### Link

```
<a
  fudis-tab-navigation-tab
  [id]="'some-id-here'"
  [active]="isActive"
  {{ I'm a link! }}
</a>
```

### Tab Navigation Panel

As a sibling you have to add the `TabNavigationPanelComponent` that is for viewing your content by using an router outlet of your choice, that you nest inside the component. You also have to add a reference to the component, as you will have to pass it to the `TabNavigationBarComponent` as a property.

```
<fudis-tab-navigation-panel [id]="'fudis-panel-1'" #navigationTabPanel>
  ...
</fudis-tab-navigation-panel>
```

## Examples

These examples are written using angular router as an reference. **However, you can use a router of your choice.**

### Usage with the Tab Navigation Panel (recommended)

This example shows the usage with the `TabNavigationPanel`. Here `ariaControls`-prop is not needed, as the panel id is passed internally to the tabs to create the needed `aria-controls` attribute.

```
<fudis-tab-navigation-bar
  [id]="'fudis-tab-navigation-1'"
  [variant]="'primary'"
  [panel]="navigationTabPanel">
  <button
    fudis-tab-navigation-tab
    *ngFor="let route of routes"
    (click)="change(route)"
    [active]="activeLink === route.path"
    [id]="route.id">
    {{ route.label }}
  </button>
</fudis-tab-navigation-bar>
<fudis-tab-navigation-panel [id]="'fudis-panel-1'" #navigationTabPanel>
  <router-outlet />
</fudis-tab-navigation-panel>
```

### Usage without the Tab Navigation Panel

If however, for some reason you can't use the `TabNavigationPanel` (for example the tab panel container is in a different component than the navigation-bar), you can implement the tab navigation panel yourself. The element needs to have the `role` of `tabpanel`, an `id` and a `aria-labelledby` that references to the current active tab `id`.

First you create a `tab-navigation-bar` with the `aria-controls`-prop and add the `fudis-tab-navigation-tab`s inside it.

```
<fudis-tab-navigation-bar
  [id]="'fudis-tab-navigation-1'"
  [aria-controls]="'tab-panel-1'"
  [variant]="'primary'"
  <button
    fudis-tab-navigation-tab
    *ngFor="let route of routes"
    (click)="change(route)"
    [active]="activeLink === route.path"
    [id]="route.id">
    {{ route.label }}
  </button>
</fudis-tab-navigation-bar>
```

Then, in the same or separate component of your choice, you declare a container, where you project the content with your router. In this example we have an active tab with id of `active-tab-1`. The `aria-labelledby` attribute value has to be updated dynamically to correspond the tab `id` that is currently active.

```
<div id="tab-panel-1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="'active-tab-1'">
  <router-outlet />
</div>
```

It is also important, that the navigation bar and the panel are located next to each other as siblings, even if they are in separate components.

## Accessibility

- The active tab is marked with `aria-selected` and the ones that are inactive, have a tabindex of -1, so the user can skip the tab listing with tab. Navigation between the tabs is done by left- and right arrow keyboard buttons.
- Tabs can be selected with space and enter keyboard buttons.
- The tabs are referencing the tab panel with `aria-controls`.
- Tab panel content is linked to the corresponding tab with `aria-labelledby`.
