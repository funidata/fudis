# Icon Button

In addition to regular [Button](/docs/components-button--documentation), Icon Button is designed to be used with icon and without visible label.
Note that it's encouraged to use Icon Button **only in situation where the action is evident and commonly recognized**. These include using icons `search`, `delete`, `close` and `zoom` for these related actions.

## Commonly used Properties

### AriaLabel (mandatory)

Since Icon Button does not have a visible label, it is mandatory to provide aria-label attribute to describe button action for assistive technology.

### Icon (mandatory)

Icon input accepts any FudisIcon. For icons that are not self-evident, always remember to provide a separate button action description.

### Size

Icon Button has three different sizes 'medium', 'small' and 'icon-only'.

### Variant

Icon Buttons are categorized based on their importance and functionality. It is **important** to use the correct variant of the button for the intended action and not to overuse them to avoid overwhelming the user.

Icon Button has three variants: `primary` (default), `secondary` and `tertiary`.

## Examples
