# Autocomplete multi-select

Autocomplete multi-select is designed to be used for search filtering views. User can choose unlimited amount of filters displayed in the dropdown and/or search for desired filter from the dropdown options list.

## Example

Tooltip can be given as an additional feature for the autocomplete-multi-select label.
