# Components

This section showcases the reusable UI building blocks available in Fudis library.

Each component is designed with accessibility in mind, following best practices to ensure inclusivity for all users.

You'll find details about inputs, outputs and usage examples on each components' _Documentation_ page to help you integrate them efficiently into your application, and to create consistent and accessible user interfaces.

Note that form components, such as text fields, selection groups and error summary are grouped under Form folder.
